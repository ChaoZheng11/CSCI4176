## Final Project Status
we can seet functionality, we finished minimum and bonus. However, we only finished units exchanged and part of driving record. Becuase of data transmission between fragments, we still did not fix some bugs. In fact, we already can get all data for driving record all we need, only transmission we did not know how to solve. The next step is to know how to transmit these data between fragments. And we want to make layout look better and improve the page of driving record.
